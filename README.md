# minilang
A very small, useless programming language that's designed and implemented very poorly

This is a project I did to one up myself. I wrote it in just under 12 hours on my day off, and it's only just below 1000 loc
at the time of writing this. I'm sure I'll refactor eventually, but I'm kinda proud of this. Anyway, here's a blurb about syntax 

# Syntax
Functions:
> function |function identifier| |*arg labels| = |expression|

Variables:
> var |variable identifier| = |expression|
